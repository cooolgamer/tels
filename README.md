## Taiwan English Language Setter

TELS is a tool to enable/disable the unused English language on the Taiwan region systems.

## What

Nintendo left an English language in all Taiwan 3DS systems. For some reasons, it goes unused. This homebrew allows you to enable and disable it.

## Notes

- Launching system settings will set the language back to Chinese.
- Not everything is translated but a good part is.
- After launching it, launch a applet (friend list, game notes etc.) to apply changes. Rebooting before doing this DO NOT work!

## Usage

- Download the CIA from the releases page and install it with FBI.
- Press A to change Switch the language.
- Press START to exit and launch a applet (friend list, game notes etc.) to apply changes.

If you want to set the language back to Chinese, rerun the application again or launch System Settings.

There is also a 3DSX option available for those who prefer 3DSX homebrew. Put it on your SD card and run it with the Homebrew Launcher or with 3dslink.
