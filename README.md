## Taiwan English Language Setter

TELS is a tool to enable/disable the unused English language on the Taiwan region systems.

## What

Nintendo left an English language in all Taiwan 3DS systems. For some reasons, it goes unused. This homebrew allows you to enable and disable it.

## Notes

- Launching system segs will set the language back to Chinese.
- Not everything is translated but a good part is.
- After launching it, launch a applet (friend list, game notes etc.) to apply changes. Rebooting before doing this DO NOT work!

## Usage

Download the CIA from the releases page and open it with FBI. Press A to change your EULA. Press START to exit the program after running it, and reboot the console to apply changes.

If you want to set the language back to Chinese, rerun the application again or launch System Settings.

There is also a 3DSX option available for those who prefer 3DSX homebrew. Put it on your SD card and run it with the Homebrew Launcher or with 3dslink. Press SELECT to remove the program after running it.
